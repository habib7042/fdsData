# 🚀 FDS - Vercel + Supabase Complete Deployment Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

The build errors have been resolved:
1. ✅ Fixed Vercel function runtime configuration error
2. ✅ Fixed Prisma client generation error

## 📋 Complete Deployment Steps

### 1. **Supabase Database Setup** (If not done yet)

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Click "New Project"
4. Project name: `fds-database`
5. Database password: (create a strong password and save it)
6. Region: `South East Asia (Singapore)` (recommended for Bangladesh)
7. Click "Create new project"

### 2. **Get Database URL**

After project creation:
1. Go to Project Settings > Database
2. Find "Connection string"
3. Copy the "URI" connection string
4. It will look like:
```
postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### 3. **Generate NextAuth Secret**

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Copy the output - this will be your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

### 4. **Vercel Deployment**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up / Log in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your `fdsData` repository
5. Click "Import"

### 5. **Set Environment Variables**

In the Vercel project configuration, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Database URL (replace with your actual Supabase URL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

# NextAuth Secret (replace with your generated secret)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-random-string-here

# NextAuth URL (will be updated after deployment)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://fds-data-[vercel-random].vercel.app
```

### 6. **Deploy**

Click the "Deploy" button. The build should now succeed!

### 7. **Update NEXTAUTH_URL**

After deployment is complete:
1. Copy your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://fds-data-xyz.vercel.app`)
2. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
3. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` with your actual Vercel URL
4. Redeploy the project

### 8. **Database Setup** (Post-Deployment)

After successful deployment, visit these URLs in order:

#### 8.1 Setup Database Schema
```
https://fds-data-[vercel-random].vercel.app/api/setup-db
```

#### 8.2 Insert Sample Data
```
https://fds-data-[vercel-random].vercel.app/api/seed
```

You should see success messages for both operations.
